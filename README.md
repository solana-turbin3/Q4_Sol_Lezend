# Lezend's Turbin3 Q4 Builders cohort work

This repository contains the work I completed as part of the Turbin3 Q4 2024 Builders cohort.

I replaced Yarn with the Bun package manager due to personal preference, as Bun is newer, faster, and gaining popularity. If Bun becomes problematic at any point, it can easily be reverted back to Yarn by deleting the `bun.lockb` file and running `yarn install` again.
